    <h2> Hi Lo Rio Rules</h2>
    <H3> The Game Explained</H3>
    <p> Players take turns building out their own River made up of ordered cards face up in front of them to achieve 6 consecutive number cards to win the game.
    At the start of every turn, every player must draw 4 cards into their hand. Each turn consists of 2 moves that MUST be played. There is no skipping.
    A move can either be playing a card from the hand to the River or playing a Discard Action of held cards.
    7s can only be played to the River as a winning move.
    </p>
    <h3> The Cards</h3>
    <p> There are 65 cards; 26 Black Cards, 26 White Cards, 13 Power Cards
    BLACK and WHITE cards are the standard cards of play. Each standard card has a matching card that is the same color. 
    POWER Cards have colored backgrounds. They are more powerful than standard cards.
    </p>
    <h3> Discard Actions</h3>
    <p> There are 4 Discard Actions in the game; Steal, Burn, Block, Exchange.</p>
    <h4>Steal</h4>
    <p>Stealing can be done two different ways; playing the Discard Action of 7 card, or Discarding two cards of the same number. 
      When attempting to Steal a card and after Discarding, the player chooses which card from which other player’s River they want to attempt to Steal. Players cannot Steal a number they already have in their own River. 
      If the Steal is successful, the card moves into the Stealing player’s River.
    </p>
    <h4>Burn</h4>
    <p>
      Burning can be done by Discarding a number from the hand that matches both the number and color of a card in any River. Power Cards can Burn ANY matching number card. If the action is successful, the targeted card is removed from the River and placed in the Discard Pile
    </p>
    <h4>Block</h4>
    <p>
      Blocking can be done by Discarding either a 7 or King. Blocks can be played out of turn and stop any Action against the player Blocking. Blocking does not count as a move. Blocks can counter other Blocks.
    </p>
    <h4>Exchange</h4>
    <p>
       Exchanging can be done by Discarding any card to the Discard Pile to immediately draw another card.
    </p>
    <h3>Extra</h3>
    <p>
      To determine who plays first, every player draws from the top of the Draw Pile. The highest number drawn goes first. <br>
      Players only draw back up to 4 cards in their hand AFTER a turn is over. All players draw back up to 4 cards in play order. <br>
      Cards do not have to be played to the River in order. Gaps in a River are OK. <br>
      There are no wrap-arounds, meaning a River cannot proceed from a King to an Ace <br>
