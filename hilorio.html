    <h2> Hi Lo Rio Rules</h2>
    <H3> The Game Explained</H3>
    <p> Players take turns building out their own River made up of ordered cards face up in front of them to achieve 6 consecutive number cards to win the game.
    At the start of every turn, every player must draw 4 cards into their hand. Each turn consists of 2 moves that MUST be played. There is no skipping.
    A move can either be playing a card from the hand to the River or playing a Discard Action of held cards.
    7s can only be played to the River as a winning move.
    </p>
    <h3> The Cards</h3>
    <p> There are 65 cards; 26 Black Cards, 26 White Cards, 13 Power Cards
    BLACK and WHITE cards are the standard cards of play. Each standard card has a matching card that is the same color. 
    POWER Cards have colored backgrounds. They are more powerful than standard cards.
    </p>
    <h3> Discard Actions</h3>
    <p> There are 4 Discard Actions in the game; Steal, Burn, Block, Exchange.</p>
    <h4>  Steal</h4>
    <p>Stealing can be done two different ways; playing the Discard Action of 7 card, or Discarding two cards of the same number. 
      When attempting to Steal a card and after Discarding, the player chooses which card from which other player’s River they want to attempt to Steal. Players cannot Steal a number they already have in their own River. 
      If the Steal is successful, the card moves into the Stealing player’s River.
